## Installation

__Updated June 18th, 2022 when blueberry was set up.__

Run `./setup/install.sh`.

That will take you through:

1. Installing Homebrew.
1. Installing and setup fish shell with `ohmyfish`, and plugins (`z`, `bass`, `git`, `starship` prompt).
1. Linking config files (`ackrc`, `agignore`, `gitignore`, `gitconfig`).
1. Installing cli tools (`ack`, `cmake`, `git`, `wget`, `yarn`, `go`, `n`, etc.) and Iosevka Nerd Font.
1. Installing cask apps: browsers, communication, development and essentials (`alfred`, `vlc`, `keepingyouawake`, `the-unarchiver` etc.). You will be asked for each app if you want to install it.
